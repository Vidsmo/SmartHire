🚀 SmartHire – AI‑Assisted Hiring Support System
SmartHire is a web‑based prototype designed to assist recruiters and candidates by using AI‑inspired intelligence to analyze resumes, compare them with job descriptions, and support fair, bias‑aware hiring decisions.
The project focuses on skills, experience, and relevance, rather than personal identifiers.

🎯 Project Objective
The traditional hiring process is often time‑consuming and prone to unconscious bias. SmartHire aims to simplify and improve this process by:

Helping recruiters quickly evaluate resumes
Providing structured feedback on candidate suitability
Demonstrating how AI concepts can be applied to HR technology
Encouraging transparent and ethical hiring practices
This project is built as an educational and conceptual HR‑tech solution.

🤖 How SmartHire Uses AI
SmartHire uses AI‑inspired, rule‑based intelligence rather than paid or external AI APIs.

AI is implemented through:
Text analysis of resumes and job descriptions
Skill and keyword extraction
Pattern matching between required and available skills
Logical scoring to generate a match percentage

This approach simulates how basic AI decision‑support systems work while remaining:

Transparent
Explainable
Free to use
Suitable for academic evaluation

🧠 AI Workflow
The user provides a Job Description

The user provides a Resume
The system processes both inputs
Relevant skills and keywords are extracted
Resume content is matched against job requirements
A match score and insights are generated
This helps recruiters focus on merit and skills, reducing bias.
It suggests if what relevant skills you can learn to increase your selection chances.
Helps schedule interview mails and answer faqs.
